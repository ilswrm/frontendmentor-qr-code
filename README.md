### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge and I learned a lot from it! 
I reinforced my understanding of basic HTML structure and how to center elements using Flexbox. 
It also helped me practice organizing my files more clearly and get comfortable using Git and GitHub. 
I also release my first project with GitHub Pages which felt like a big win!
